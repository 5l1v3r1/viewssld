  * Outputting a fake 3-way TCP handshake for the decrypted traffic
  * Outputting the decrypted server replies as well as the client requests, keeping the (fake) TCP sequence numbers properly up to date
  * Outputting a fake RST at the end of each session
  * Using an easily-searchable IP Ident number for all the fake frames so you can tell which ones were output by viewssld (54609 == 0xd551 == DSSL J )
  * Outputting the decrypted frames on a different port to which they were captured on (e.g. 443->80, 465->25, 993->143, etc.)
